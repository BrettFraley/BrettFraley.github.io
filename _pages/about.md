With 8 years of professional experience as a software engineer, I have worked with various technologies on both small and massive, mission-critical software products and services.

In the last year, I discovered the world of healthcare IT, and I am excited about the future of technology in this evolving industry. As a highly experienced software engineer with only basic knowledge in biology, biochemistry, and genomics, I have been taking MOOC courses in health informatics systems and bioinformatics.

I am currently working towards earning a CAHIMS certification and am also looking to contribute to open-source bioinformatics projects. Additionally, I am interested in volunteer or entry-level positions for any organization seeking software talent to aid in their bioinformatics research or products.
