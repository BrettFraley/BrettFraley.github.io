# Personal website of @BrettFraley

Hi, my site is a simple Jekyll/GH pages site.

I started with the Reverie theme, shout out to the authors.

I write technical articles, notes, and rants here. You'll find my art,
ideas, and updates about projects and things I'm working on.

If for some reason you're reading this and have something
related to my website to discuss, then feel free to open
an issue in this repository and tag me with @BrettFraley.

Cheers!
