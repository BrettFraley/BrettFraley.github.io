Eggs move, and only turn on certain times of day
Eggs have a difficulty level
Some eggs are invisible and either code or network based
Some eggs may exist off of the site, but there's a path to them

ACGT - DNA String
ACGU - RNA String
-------------------------
Transcribing DNA into RNA
-------------------------
An RNA string is a string formed from the alphabet containing 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'U'.

Given a DNA string t
corresponding to a coding strand, its transcribed RNA string U
is formed by replacing all occurrences of 'T' in t with 'U' in U.
ACGU

-----------------------------
Complementing a Strand of DNA
-----------------------------
In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other, as are 'C' and 'G'.

The reverse complement of a DNA string s
is the string sc formed by reversing the symbols of s,
then taking the complement of each symbol (e.g., the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC").

AAAACCCGGT = ACCGGGTTTT



const strandLength = 64

let DNA = ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']
let RNA = ['A', 'C', 'G', 'U']

const genStrand = chars => {
  let strand = ""
  for (i = 0; i < strandLength; i++) {
    let char = Math.floor(Math.random()*4)
    strand += chars[char]
  }
  return strand
}

an initial egg player / seeker upon finding the first egg
posts to SQLite a new table with a table name generated 
from their first egg id. Once they find the first egg, ids for the
rest of the eggs are generated as well and stored as rows in their table.
This way, table names and each row of each table will collectively be unique
and verified.. If a table id or table id with mismatched rows are tampered with,
then there table is reset. This can be done with python anywhere and bottle,
or some free server. The users local storage and or SQLite in browser storage
can be synced and verified in this way.
