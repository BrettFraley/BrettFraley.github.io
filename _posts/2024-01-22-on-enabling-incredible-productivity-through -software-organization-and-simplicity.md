On Enabling Incredible Productivity Through Software, Organization, & Simplicity (KISS)

### Introduction
This article is about being productive, making progress that counts, completing tasks and projects,
finishing that next course, reading that next book. It isn't advice on setting or reaching goals. 
It is about identifying what works for you or an organization to enable the ability to reach goals.
It is about clearing the path from obstacles and then upgrading your mode of transport along said path.

The first half is the sections on drive and passion, and lost notes. The second half is for anyone who uses software daily in their career, creative, or hobby work (which is practically everyone!)

It is about becoming incredibly productive and organized through
software. It is also a bit of a personal retrospective on simplicity, good concise tools, and tips for software engineers.

As of this writing, we are 3 weeks into the month of January 2024.
Goals, tasks, notes, schedules, emails, browser tabs, diagrams, charts, and ideas abound!

### Clutter Out, Incredible Productivity In

An influx of information and work are overflowing and scattered across multiple software tools,
notebooks, Github repositories, whiteboard scribbles, and are entangled across the desks, kitchen tables, 
and white brain matter of individuals and entire organizations. 

***More than ever, our minds and daily hustle are like a busy harbor where hundred other ships are waiting to enter the port to load and unload their cargo. -Brett Fraley 2024 (yes, I just made that up and am proud of it)***

Before I dive into hyper-productivity, software, simplicity, and automation, below is a quote from the following source on 'white brain matter': https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318966

"
***One study [Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1859842/), for instance, found a relationship between white matter structure and IQ, the authors of which concluded that “cognitive function correlates with greater fiber organization.” Similarly, other scientistsTrusted Source have found links between the quality of white matter in an adult’s brain and their reading ability.***

***Researchers have also demonstrated that using our brains in a specific way can change the structure of white matter. For instance, one experiment found that regularly practicing a musical instrument increases the level of organization within white matter in the areas important for musical performance. The researchers showed that the amount of change was proportional to the number of hours the individual practiced. The more you work, the more white matter is modified.***

Let's Get into it! Just in the first 20 minutes of sitting down to write, I searched my bookmarks to be able to link to the above article, saved one of the images from the website and made it my desktop background, refilled my coffee mug, jotted down some notes to attempt at organizing my thoughts, and
jumped over to YouTube to put on some 'Tokyo Retro Lo-fi tunes'. Which, obviously is relevant to topic(s) at hand
***because concentration matters*** and is a hot commodity these days. ***How will I finish this article?***

To guide myself along, I'll first break down my thoughts into a concise list! What is the estimated time to complete the list? What are key points behind each topic? 

__Lesson 1:__ Screw the list because I risk getting stuck in the middle of one of the sections and not moving onto the next until tomorrow, and tomorrow I can and should be working on something else!

### The Need For Drive & Passion Amongst Lists of Tasks

It's difficult to be inspired by mundane tasks. Either eliminate those tasks, automate them, or push through them
in light of the greater end goal or the purpose of the task. Drive and passion for reaching a desired outcome can't
be found in a spreadsheet (depending on the numbers and data). You won't find drive or passion in your to do list. Perhaps you'll find insight, inspiration, an outline of subtasks, and a sense of being organized, but consider completing the first item on that list and tossing the rest.

Your list is bound to change and may not matter tomorrow. If what you need to accomplish is important enough, it is most likely so prominent in the forefront and focus of your mind that you probably didn't need a list.

### The Turbulent Sea of Lost Notes In Bottles
Brainstorming can be an essential tool. Choosing goals, measuring progress, and prioritization of work is a priceless necessity, but these sort of processes should consume a small percentage of effort compared to taking action and actually moving forward.

Particularly in software development, too much emphasis on what I'll call 'setup' time and planning tend to lead to large amounts of metadata, logs, design artifacts, diagrams, email chains, and documentation scattered across various tools, departments, user machines and even handwritten notes. If much of this effort ends up deprecated or irrelevant, trash it! Although, these are essential to project planning, communications, tracking a project's lifespan and progress, it surely isn't always valuable data to keep around.

When entire teams spend more time writing and tracking down this data and documentation than actually completing the next prioritized work, then simplification and consolidation of 'planning' may be much more valuable than the act of extensive planning itself, while increasing productivity.

***Status update and todo list for this article, because if you're reading and made it this far, let's get organized and focus:***

___List Length: 1, Time Allotted: 30 seconds, Total Time Writing So Far: 45 mins, Editing Time: 1 minute of spellcheck and pure procrastination, Reader Engagement and Confidence: Doesn't Matter, Word Count:  987 words 6,231 characters, Time spent on wordcounter.net: 1 minute, Time Spent on this metadata of progress as some fun satire: 5 mins and priceless, Status: Done :)___

 Summarizing up this section is a metaphor to household chores, and then I'll move onto software, where I'll describe some tools and tips I've picked up (the hard way) on my ***quest to being incredibly productive in 2024!***
 
If I have a list of 20 household chores to do, I could easily spend 20 minutes (1 minute per task) setting goals for each. I'd set start and stop times for each task, color code the items, switch around their order, list supplies needed for each chore, chores that must come before other chores, and chores in order to increase enablement of doing chores. That is if only in handwritten format.

Imagine the list is on a phone's todo app, a personal scrum board, on a cloud provider's site where there's a needed software update, on local project planning software which of course the reset my password link isn't working! In that time, you can bet
that I'll already have the dishes done, the lawn mowed, and reading the next chapter of a book!
