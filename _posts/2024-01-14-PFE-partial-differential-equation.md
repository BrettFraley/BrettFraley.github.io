title: PDE - On Learning Partial Differential Equations
categories: [Software Engineering, Journal, LearningAboutX]
---

*What are PDEs in software engineering?* I'm asking for a friend, I sware.
Just kidding, partial differential equations are a subject matter I am going to learn,
and am going to write about it as I go. By documenting my learning experience and posting
about it, forces me to not only understand the concepts well enough to write about it,
it gives me momentum to not stop after only learning a little. Choosing to write about
PDE's and produce something interesting and of value to others and perhaps even teach others
what I currently know very little about, is my way of persevering to thoroughly study 
and undertand PDEs and how to apply them in software solutions. I will be tackling this
subject in this manner on many areas of study and will tag articles with the 'LearningAboutX'.

### Day 1
I was glancing through some free books on computer vision and the acronym PDE was mentioned. 
- I asked Chat GPT, "What is a PDE in computers and imaging?." I will post the response below
another time in a little dropdown, but for now I'm moving on.
- Next I started this post in order to solidify my commitment to understanding PDEs.
- Plan for Day 2 is to study PDE concepts for a minimum of 1 hour and update post here
because I have to move on to other things for the rest of my evening.
