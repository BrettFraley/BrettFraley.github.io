title: PDE - On Learning Partial Differential Equations

*What are PDEs in software engineering?* I'm asking for a friend, I sware.
Just kidding, partial differential equations are a subject matter I am going to learn,
and am going to write about it as I go. By documenting my learning experience and posting
about it, forces me to not only understand the concepts well enough to write about it,
it gives me momentum to not stop after only learning a little. Choosing to write about
PDE's and produce something interesting and of value to others and perhaps even teach others
what I currently know very little about, is my way of persevering to thoroughly study 
and undertand PDEs and how to apply them in software solutions. I will be tackling this
subject in this manner on many areas of study and will tag such articles with 'LearningAboutX'.

### Day 1
I was glancing through some free books on computer vision and the acronym PDE was mentioned. 
- I asked Chat GPT, "What is a PDE in computers and medical imaging?." The response is below,
and although I have been studying these concepts in my journey into bioinformatics,
computational biology, and software engineering in the medical space, I didn't realize
that partial differential equations are key to many of the algorithms used in medical imaging
analysis.
- Next I started this post in order to solidify my commitment to understanding PDEs.
- Plan for Day 2 is to study PDE concepts for a minimum of 1 hour and update post here
because I have to move on to other things for the rest of my evening.

#### ChatGPT Response:

In the context of computers and medical imaging, "PDE" typically stands for Partial Differential Equation. Partial Differential Equations are mathematical equations that involve multiple variables and their partial derivatives. These equations are used to model various physical phenomena, including those encountered in medical imaging.

In medical imaging, PDEs are often employed for tasks such as image denoising, image segmentation, and image registration. Here's a brief overview of how PDEs are used in these applications:

1. **Image Denoising:**
   - PDEs can be used to develop algorithms for removing noise from medical images. The equation is formulated to smooth out noise while preserving important image features.

2. **Image Segmentation:**
   - PDE-based segmentation methods are used to partition an image into meaningful regions or objects. These methods help identify and delineate structures of interest within medical images.

3. **Image Registration:**
   - PDEs play a role in image registration, where the goal is to align or match different medical images of the same patient or organ. Registration involves solving optimization problems often formulated using PDEs.

4. **Medical Image Reconstruction:**
   - In certain medical imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PDEs are used in image reconstruction algorithms. These algorithms aim to reconstruct high-quality images from acquired data.

5. **Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI):**
   - PDEs are used in diffusion tensor imaging, a technique in medical imaging that measures the diffusion of water molecules in tissues. PDEs model the diffusion process, and their solutions provide insights into tissue microstructure.

6. **Dynamic Imaging:**
   - PDEs are applied in dynamic imaging scenarios, such as analyzing the flow of contrast agents in medical imaging studies. The equations help describe the dynamics of contrast enhancement over time.

The use of PDEs in medical imaging reflects the interdisciplinary nature of the field, where mathematical and computational methods are employed to enhance the quality and interpretability of medical images. Researchers and practitioners often develop and customize PDE-based algorithms to address specific challenges in medical image analysis and processing.
