In my father's garage there are many tool boxes, obviously containing many of tools
for just about everything Many od them for the same things, but in all sorts of shapes,
colors, and sizes. I guess that goes for a lot of things you may keep in the garage, around
the house, and just life in general.

They aren't kept in any certain spot or method of organization.
They end up where they end up. Of course, the one time you need a very soecific tool
or size, it can't be found or is the last place you check. Yes, this is an
analogy, but actually is a true descrtiption and story.

There is one specific toolbox in his garage that is organized. It's rather old, rustic (not rusty),
and super heavy duty. All of the tools in this box are 60-70 years old, have withstood the
test of time and some of the best wrenches and tools ever made.

See, this was my grandfather's toolbox, whom was a diesal mechanic back in the day.
There's extermemly specific brake tools in there for old Mac semi trucks that are truly works
of art. There is something to be said about the tools we use everyday throughout our lives.
Even as they change, improve, or become obsolote, there's some in that old tried and true
toolbox that have and probably always will withsatnd the test of time.

Now, let's talk software!
