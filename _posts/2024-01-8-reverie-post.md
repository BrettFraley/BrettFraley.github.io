### On The Reverie Jekyll Theme, Github Pages

Check it out, I'm a software engineer. I love to code, 
design user interfaces, setup and automate development
environments, learn new languages, frameworks,
and tools. But, did I feel like relearning Jekyll, setting
up a local Ruby environment, altering themes and debugging
the initial theme's CSS today? ***Absolutely not!***

The most straight forward and fastest way to start
my new personal site today (this site) in less than 30 minutes
was using [this free Reverie Jekyll theme](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie).

It's 2024! I have too many projects and work to focus on
as a software engineer to spend all day setting up a new 
personal website for myself. _Yes, that's a 2024 resolution!_

This setup saved me a few hours of tinkering and getting
every little thing just right. Another 2024 goal is to start
making webdev videos and writing articles and tutorials. So,
perhaps one of my first quick videos will be on how quickly,
and easily anyone can setup a Jekyll Github pages site and 
have it published online instantly.
