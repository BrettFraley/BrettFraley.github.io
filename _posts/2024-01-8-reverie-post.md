# On The Reverie Jekly Theme, Github Pages

Check it out, I'm a software engineer and love to code, 
design user interfaces, setup and automate development
environments, learn new front and backend languages, frameworks,
tools, etc. But, did I feel like relearning Jekyll, setting
up a local Ruby environment, and altering themes and debugging
the initial theme's CSS today? Absolutely not!

The most straight forward and fastest way to start
my new personal site today (this site) in less than 30 minutes
was using the free Reverie Jekyll theme. 

It's 2024! I have too many projects and work to focus on
as a software engineer to spend all day setting up a new 
personal website for myself. _Yes, that's a 2024 resolution
and this setup saved me a few hours of tinkering and getting
every little thing just right._
