In the last year (2023-2024), I discovered the world of healthcare IT,
and I am excited about the future of technology in this evolving industry.
As a highly experienced software engineer with only basic knowledge in
biology, biochemistry, and genomics, I have been taking MOOC courses in
health informatics systems and bioinformatics.
      
I am currently working towards earning a CAHIMS certification and am also looking
to contribute to open-source bioinformatics projects. Additionally, I am interested
in volunteer or entry-level positions for any organization seeking software talent to
aid in their bioinformatics research or products.
