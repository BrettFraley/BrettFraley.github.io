I discovered something very important about myself that I am sending off
into the ether in a brain dump here today

I realized that somewhere along the years I lost the flare and
inspiration for creativity, learning, and being open and honest with others.
I used to play guitar and have written a bunch of songs, but always afraid to
sing them for others (that's true but alkso an analogy to many things).
I realized that my mind used to be free, but more importantly it still is,
and that it's only myself that has held in the creative spirit inside.

I've decided to sing. I've decided to write. I've decided to create, everyday.
Somewhere inside was an inner child of repressed expression and I've uncaged
that awesome kid.

I always wanted to be an author, a musician, an entrepreneur, and more!

I decided that I could read a book about writing. Or, I could just write.
I could read a book or take a tutorial on the latest programming language or framework,
or go ahead and spend my time building something new on my own, while of course referencing
documentation and googling when needed. The point is, I'll be creating while learning
(learning while doing), and I';ll encounter problems and needs that I wouldn't
have encountered in an article or book and know how to solve my own specific issues,
leading to an overall more rewarding learning experience - while maybe ending up
with something interesting or of value that I can point at and say, "look, I did that. I made that",
even if only to myself.

So, this morning (admittedly after a late night of working on one of my latest software endeavors),
I'm letting my thoughts out. I'm writing. I'm making mistakes, and I'll edit them later.
I'll learn by editing them. I'll even publish my mistakes. Many of which, I
won't entirely realize or be aware that they are mistakes. Until, I share them with others
and others learn from them.

If I write a bad song, like the worst song in history, I will never know I wrote the worst song
in history unless I shed my skin and put it out there and others are like, "nah man, um dude that
really is the worst song ever". What's important is that I wrote the song, that I created,
produced something, wasn't scared to give it a shot, and then improve iteratovely.
What's important is to not be scared to put yourself, or ego on the line. Let's say I did manage
to produce the most god awful musical arrangement of notes, chords, melodies, and instruments
that mankind has ever heard - I had the time to do so because I wasn't reading a book or following
a step by step tutorial on music theory or songwriting (which yes would help if such a sonjg was THAT bad).
What I'm saying is that one can only hold off from actually being creative on their own, producing,
getting things done, learning from mistakes or issues directly within your work by wondering
waht others may think, by wondering how the pros do it "the right way", developing the perfect
plan or strategy.

For example, let's say I have an idea for a new SaaS product.. (everyone has one, I know),
and I'm like ya know I think I'm on to something here. If you're not 100% ready to invest
all of your time and energy into researching your target market, forming a "real" business
plan over weeks or months, then maybe just spend a weekend fleshing out a prototype and build
the damn thing. Then you have a very powerful, insightful, evidence based tool at your disposal.
I'm looking and winking at you business intelligence people. You'll have someting tangible,
even if a digital product, to help guide "for real market research" and the solution that
was only ideas in your mind, or on paper, spreadsheets, or whiteboard.

This rant, yes it's a rant isn't about entrepreneurship or SaaS startup strategies though.
I just lead to that as an example. I didn't think about or plan on sitting down and writing all this
on this morning at 5am. I just decided I am going to write. I didn't stare at a blank screen
wondering what a good topic, title, or audience I'd be writing to (which, is actually a super
important part of good writing, I know - is considering or deciding who your audience is),
because you know what? I'd still be thinking of a title, a subject matter, an audience. I would
have written a list of possible titles, subject matter, etc first, instead of all of this.
I would have looked at trends, audience engagement - well shit and it's a good thing that
I'm not using a normal word document program because I would still be deciding which layout
to use and whether sans or sans-serif made my audience feel one way or another. Instead,
I made something. I got my thoughts out, many of which I wouldn't have at all.

See, it's the same as the SaaS topic above. As I am in the middle of actually doing,
and creating, new ideas and considerations, and directions are coming to mind. Andf just like
having that MVP, prototype, rough sketch or proof of concept to start, guide, and move your
weork forward, I've discivered things along the way in even just writing this article.
Now, I can take what I've produced, iterate on it, imporove it, publish it, and move the hell
on. And as I write this, to whomever reads it. Obviously, I didn't take much time
to edit, or format it, or make it perfect - because obviously it's not and there's
nothing wrong with that. But, I have something tro work with, to keep, to share,
to learn from. And, ultimately that is what this morning's rant is all about. It's about having
something you made or did that may have some value or bring something to other people's lives,
whatever that may be. Spark conversation about you care about. Invoke a feeling, a connection with
others about what interests you, what you enjoy doing, or are doing.
Whether business related, a creative project, or something as simple as making and keeping
plans with friends or family, don't overthink or overplan. Plan some, but once you actually
just dive in, you'll have plenty more to plan for and about because you'll have something
of value. You'll have results. Replace the items in your plan. Replace the goals on your list.
Replace them with results.
